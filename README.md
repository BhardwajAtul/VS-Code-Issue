Whenever there is a popup like the issue reporter window i'm describing my issue in, or clicking on another window in multi window view the Visual Studio Code becomes like a 144p video in a TV screen. Its not even readable. And when the Visual Studio Code is selected again it unblurrs itself and becomes clear again. Its like it moves to background and comes foreground again. Also currently other than the text box i'm typing in, all above texts of this form are blurred.
